## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
#Ques1 .a
name <- "Hitesh Kumar"
print(name)
cat("\n")
roll <- 244161004
print(roll)
#b 
if (roll %% 2 == 0){
  cat("\n")
  print("even")
}else {
  cat("\n")
  print("odd")
}
```

```{r}
#Q2.
x <- c(seq(11,56,by=2))
print(x)
print(mean(x))
print(var(x))
print(sd(x))
```


```{r}
#Q2 density plot
plot(density(x))

```

`
```{r}
#Q3.
x <- rnorm(12)
y <- rnorm(53)
z <- c(x,y)
print(z)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
#Q4.
#a.
height <- rnorm(100,mean = 150,sd=3.16)
print(height)
```
```{r}
#b.
weight <- rnorm(100,mean = 70,sd = 7.07)
print(weight)
```
```{r}
#c.
hwdf = data.frame(height,weight)
print(hwdf)
```
```{r}
#d.
print(dim(hwdf))
```
```{r}
#e.
print(str(hwdf))
```
```{r}
#f
#first 15 rows
head(hwdf,15)
```


```{r}
#f last 13 rows
tail(hwdf,13)
```


```{r}
#h
h1 <- subset(hwdf ,select = 1)
print(h1)
```


```{r}
#i 
h170 <- hwdf[hwdf$height>170,]
print(h170)
```
```{r}
#j
w45 <- hwdf[hwdf$weight<45,]
print(w45)
```
```{r}
#k
hw1 <- hwdf[hwdf$height>160,hwdf$weight>90]
head(hw1,10)
```
```{r}
#l
hw2 <- hwdf[hwdf$height<150 & hwdf$weight>80,]
print(hw2)
```


```{r}
#m

pairs(~weight+height,data=hwdf,main="scatterplot matrix of height and width")
```


```{r}
#m 
print("Height column ranges from 145 to 155 ,below and above it are outliers")
```


```{r}

data(hwdf)

boxplot(hwdf$weight, hwdf$height, 
        names = c("Weight", "Height"), 
        main = "Boxplot of Weight and Height", 
        ylab = "Values", 
        col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"))

```
```{r}

# Histogram for Weight

     main = "Histogram of Weight", 
     xlab = "Weight", 
     ylab = "Count", 
     col = "lightblue", 
     border = "black", 
     breaks = 10)  # Adjust breaks as needed

# Histogram for Height

     main = "Histogram of Height", 
     xlab = "Height", 
     ylab = "Count", 
     col = "lightgreen", 
     border = "black", 
     breaks = 10) 

```


```{r}
#m 
print("incase of height it ranges 145 to 155 ,and in case of weight it ranges from 55 to 85")
```


```{r}
